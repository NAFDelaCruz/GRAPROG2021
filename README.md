# GRAPROG2021 repository reminders

Welcome to our repository for our game in GRAPROG

When uploading new asset folders, follow the folder directory style just like in Unity.
Example:
Character sprite folder goes into: Assets > Art > Character Sprites 

If your Git is not directly working with Unity, make sure all your files or folders have the same name 
as the ones in the repository so that your uploaded files will overwrite the existing version if that's the case.

Lastly, do not directly commit your files to the main branch especially if it's a change in the scripts, create a pull request instead so we all can verify
if everything is correct or working before we merge it to the main branch.


Good luck everyone and let's get this bread. ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ
